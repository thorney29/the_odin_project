	<h2>Active learning: Launch countdown!</h2>
<p>In this exercise, we want you to print out a simple launch countdown to the output box, from 10 down to Blastoff. Specifically, we want you to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Loop from 10 down to 0. We've provided you with an initializer — let i = 10;.</li>
<li>For each iteration, create a new paragraph and append it to the output <div>, which we've selected using const output = document.querySelector('.output');.</li> 
<li>In comments, we've provided you with three code lines that need to be used somewhere inside the loop:
<ul>
	<li>const para = document.createElement('p'); — creates a new paragraph.</li>
	<li>output.appendChild(para); — appends the paragraph to the output </li>
	<li>para.textContent = — makes the text inside the paragraph equal to whatever you put on the right-hand side, after the equals sign.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Different iteration numbers require different text to be put in the paragraph for that iteration (you'll need a conditional statement and multiple para.textContent = lines):
<ul>
	<li>If the number is 10, print "Countdown 10" to the paragraph.</li>
	<li>If the number is 0, print "Blast off!" to the paragraph.</li>
	<li>For any other number, print just the number to the paragraph.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Remember to include an iterator! However, in this example we are counting down after each iteration, not up, so you don't want i++ — how do you iterate downwards?</li>
</ul>
